* :lemon: Lemon

*Lemon* is a set of scripts that interact with lemonbar to provide a
customizable status bar for your desktop environment. 

** :lemon: Motivation

There are many options for status bars out there. Many of them semi-unique
scripts living in folks' dotfiles built from the ground up that interact with lemonbar. 
A lot of these implementations were built to get the job done and then
forgotten about. I used borrowed versions of a few of these for a few
years but then became frustrated when having to modify them due to lack of
extensibility and modularity. 

Another option which is great is
[[https://github.com/polybar/polybar][polybar]] - check it out if you haven't
already. I used it for a while but ran into consistent high CPU usage spikes
which may or may not be fixed in later versions. 
I also find bash scripting fun so I wanted to move to a set up that was more bare-bones 
where I could create a simple script and then plug it into the bar via a configuration file.
That's why this project exists.

** :lemon: Example

Here's an example bar for what I'm running day-to-day:
[[file:https://github.com/novcn/lemon/blob/master/screens/ss.png]]

Here's the configuration I used for this bar:
[[file:https://github.com/novcn/lemon/blob/master/screens/config-sample.png]]

Pretty straight-forward right?

As you can see the =left=, =center=, and =right= variables are set with a list of different values. Each
of these strings reference a script in the =juice= directory. The script when
called will set a font-awesome icon via =utils/icon= script and then some
value. 

** :lemon: Juice

If you're going to use this project you'll likely need to write some of your own juice scripts. Luckily that is easy to do. A great example of a functional simple =juice= is the =clock= script:
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
#!/bin/bash
icon clock

date '+%I:%M:%S %p'
#+END_SRC
All it does is set the icon to clock - this corresponds to [[https://fontawesome.com/icons/clock?style=solid][font-awesome-clock]] and then prints out a formatted time. 

For a slightly more complex example checkout 
[[file:https://github.com/novcn/lemon/blob/master/juice/weather][juice/weather]] which requires a network request so it'll cache to the filesystem in case network drops off and also to limit requests to 1 per minute.
